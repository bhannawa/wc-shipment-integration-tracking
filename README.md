Requires:
- EITHER [GoShippo](https://goshippo.com/) API Integration OR [Pirate Ship](https://www.pirateship.com/) API Integration
- [Zorem Advanced Shipment Tracking (AST) plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-advanced-shipment-tracking/)

This plugin improves the shipping integrations from GoShippo and Pirate Ship. Both send the tracking number to WooCommerce through order notes, so this plugin checks API order notes for USPS and UPS tracking numbers and applies them to the order using AST. This is helpful because it shows the tracking number on the admin order dashboard and makes it more useable in order completed/shipped emails.
